Display video content using the [video-js] shortcode

== Description ==

The *Video.js Shortcode* plugin was written to allow users to easily display mp4, ogg, and webm video files without knowing PHP or editing template files.

Add the shortcode in a post or page, and use the arguments to query based on tag, category, post type, and many other possibilities (see the Arguments). I've also added some extra options to display something more than just the title: include_date, include_excerpt, and image_size.

See the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query) for information on using the arguments.

**No support will be provided by the developer**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `video-js-shortcode` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
1. Add the shortcode to a post or page. 


== Changelog ==

**Version 1.0.0**

* This is version 1.0.0  Everything's new!
